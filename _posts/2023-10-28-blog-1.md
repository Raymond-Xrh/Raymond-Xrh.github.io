1. Math is the language of modern science. With a foundation in undergraduate mathematics, you won't be daunted by the sigma's and delta's in advanced research. Instead, you approach them with the mindset of, "This Math describes the concept, and here's the object in a more intuitive context. Let's tackle them one by one."

2. Math cultivates rigor and intuition in a harmonious way. You learn to challenge intuition after countering countless counter-intuitive examples. You learn to cooperate with intuition after feeling lost in the labyrinth of symbols. The skill is transferable to any other domain of knowledge: Allow your intuition to guide you, while rigorously examining them.
