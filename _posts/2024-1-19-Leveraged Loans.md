Second layer: why leveraged loans trading at premium?
---

Usually it's because of: (1) declining interest rates, (2) improved creditworthiness, (3) higher demand for loan relative to other investments.

Investor expectation of rate cut => willing to pay premium to lock in higher spreads before rates cut materialize
There were concerns that companies that had borrowed heavily before 2022 would be in trouble once rates started surging. But loan default rate by 2023 remained below historical average. Why? Companies successfully replaced older debt with new bonds.
High interest rate => slow down in PE buyout deals => fewer loan issuance (low supply) => higher prices of leveraged loans
