1. Math is the language of modern science. With a foundation in undergraduate mathematics, you won't be daunted by the sigma's and delta's in advanced research. Instead, you approach them with the mindset of, "Here's the Math that describes the concept; here's the concept in its original context. Let's tackle them one by one."

You learn to cooperate with intuition after feeling lost in the labyrinth of symbols. The skill is transferable to any other domain of knowledge: Allow your intuition to guide you, while rigorously examining them.
