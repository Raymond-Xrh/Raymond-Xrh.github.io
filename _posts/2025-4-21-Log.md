An exploration on logarithm and how it relates to options

Intuition for e and log
===

Just like Pi, $e$ is not just a random constant called 2.71828. For any circle, if you divide its circumference by diameter, you always get Pi. For any system with continuous, compound growth (population, interest, stock price in Black-Scholes world), You can describe its growth rate using base $e$. It demonstrates the explanatory power of mathematics: any circle can be considered a scaled version of the unit circle, and every rate of growth can be considered a scaled version of $e$.

Suppose one day you pick up a magical coin that doubles every year: $1, 2, 4, 8, \dots$ It’s easy to generalize a formula for growth at year x:

$$
\text{Growth} = 2^x = \left(1 + \text{100\%}\right)^x = (1 + r)^x
$$

Not bad, huh?

Now let's take it further. So far, we assume throughout year 1 we only have $1, and then "BOOM" —— the second we step into year 2 we get $2. What if 6 months into year 1, we already receive $0.5 who compounds the same way as the original 1? In that case, at the end of year 1 we have $\left(1 + \frac{100\%}{2}\right)^2 = 2.25$. As the frequency of compounding goes to infinity, we approach:

$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n
$$

The lesson here is that e is the **maximum** possible result when compounding 100% growth over one time period. That means at most, you can end up with around $2.718 by the end of year 1. Now suppose you have 2 magical coins instead. You will end up with $5.436. For $n$ coins, you’ll get $n \cdot e$. 

But what if your magical coin only grows at 50% per year? Without doing too much math,

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{0.5}{n}\right)^n = e^{0.5}
$$

That is:

$$
\text{Growth} = e^{rate \cdot time}
$$


To get the same growth as a 100% coin in 1 year, it would take a 50% coin **2 years**
