How To Trade Tariff Day by The Macro Trading Floor
===

### Hook:
Markets across option, fx, equity, bond consencus are not fully pricing in tariff tail events. Over the last 10 days, data has been supportive of a soft landing narrative, with:
- 5% annualized retail sales growth, signaling healthy consumer demand
- A decent labor market report
- PCE inflation at 2.3%, a friendly inflation number
- A dovish Fed, with Waller hinting 3-4 cuts this year

If Trump isn't specific about tariffs, you could get a vicious rally. Recall in 2017 dollar collapsed 


### Positioning + momentum
1. Prepositioning: Consider 3 scenarios: heavy tariff, targeted tariff, and no tariff. Estimate probability + magnitude/drawdown, and compare to market implied. Trade base case or tail case. 
2. Momentum: If I expect DAX to move up 400 points I would enter at 100. The edge is to digest news faster than large institutions, which takes 6h - 24h to position.

### How does 10% tariff affects bond market?
- 10y or 30y bond are about where fed fund rate will be between now and the next 10 years.
