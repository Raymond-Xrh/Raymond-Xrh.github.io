The Next Big Macro Trade 2025.2.21
===

### Bond and Dollar
- Dollar position based on CFTC, CTA, and risk reversal is flat, compared to record long at the start of 2025. However, EUR/USD merely rose from 1.035 to 1.042. The massive change in positioning doesn't affect price much.
- Tariff


How To Trade Tariff Day by The Macro Trading Floor 2025.1.17
===

### Hook:
Markets across option, fx, equity, bond consencus are not fully pricing in tariff tail events. Over the last 10 days, data has been supportive of a soft landing narrative, with:
- 5% annualized retail sales growth, signaling healthy consumer demand
- A decent labor market report
- PCE inflation at 2.3%, a friendly inflation number
- A dovish Fed, with Waller hinting 3-4 cuts this year

If Trump isn't specific about tariffs, you could get a vicious rally. Recall in 2017 dollar collapsed 


### Positioning + momentum
1. Prepositioning: Consider 3 scenarios: heavy tariff, targeted tariff, and no tariff. Estimate probability + magnitude/drawdown, and compare to market implied. Trade base case or tail case. 
2. Momentum: If I expect DAX to move up 400 points I would enter at 100. The edge is to digest news faster than large institutions, which takes 6h - 24h to position.

### How does 10% tariff affects bond market?
When you think about 10y or 30y bond price, it is about
- where fed fund rate will be between now and the next 10 years
- uncertainty of growth and inflation => long-term bond duration risk, term premiums, etc.

Long term bond would rally for a few reasons:
- Though offset by a stronger USD, Tariff could cause a bump in import prices and short-term inflation. But this wouldn't affect long-term rates, thus no term premium
- Tariff could slow down global trade/economy, making bond more valuable

### D1 vs option
- D1: risk of liquidity gap, i.e. stop loss at a worse price due to slippage. If you long USD/CAD but no tariff is announced, there would be few bids for you to stop loss.
- Option: no stopped out, but pays time decay; need to get both time and direction right
- Often implied vol anchors at realized vol. When realized has been low implied vol can be underpriced.
