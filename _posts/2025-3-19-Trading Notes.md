How To Trade Tariff Day by The Macro Trading Floor
===

### Hook:
Markets across option, fx, equity, bond consencus are not fully pricing in tariff tail events. Over the last 10 days, data has been supportive of a soft landing narrative, with:
- 5% annualized retail sales growth, signaling healthy consumer demand
- A decent labor market report
- PCE inflation at 2.3%, a friendly inflation number
- A dovish Fed, with Waller hinting 3-4 cuts this year
If Trump isn't specific about tariffs, you could get a vicious rally.
