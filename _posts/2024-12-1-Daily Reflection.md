Todo: do 3 problems; arrange driving license tests

Result: finished all

Read "Creative Thinking” by Claude Shannon. 

Reflect on V interview. Practice independent problem solving while talking to a person

I realized my ego prevents me from taking a critical but right feedback. Embrace that I could be stupid and wrong.

Todo: practice 10 virtu question in 1h 

Result: finished 7/10 questions by the end of the day, with 3 harder questions left.

Reflect: I tend to procastinate on more complicated questions. Incorporate this fact in tomorrow's plan

2 days off

O feedback:
Elaborate on forward-looking questions: what struggles I might face in the next internship, what I might not enjoy, discretionary vs systematic. Don't overly rely on past experiences reason about future. Technically I am naturally methodical and need to be more intuitive.

Affirmation and proactive reflections are effective.

刚刚走在回家的路上，有很多落下的银杏叶，就像南京的一样。我想起来3年前遇到的许多人，3年后和他们交谈感觉基本没有变化。随着环境变化大家都多了domain knowledge，但人是没变的。我不希望别人和我聊天时也有这种感觉。三年前我犯的错，我的好高骛远，不自律，封闭，我看到仍然在现在的我身上。Be more conscientious about the mistakes I made, things I failed to do. 接受不适感，不断改进。

The value of college lies in knowledge and connections. With AI's rise, acquiring knowledge has shifted from studying textbooks to finding data sources and understanding key matters. College doesn't teach you any of these. What truly matters now are connections. Focus on understanding the passions of those around you.

**Dealing with failure**

My response to failure has been essentially 5 steps: denial - anger - bargaining - depressed - acceptance. When rejected after an interview, my initial reaction is denial: *How is that possible? I didn’t do badly at all*. Then comes anger: *This is ridiculous, I don’t care about them anyway*. Next, I bargain, seeking alternatives like reapplying to other offices. When those efforts fail, sadness sets in—I regret my laziness, lack of preparation, or freezing under pressure. Eventually, I accept it and move on.

The solution? Embrace the negative feelings, shorten the cycle, and return to my routine with renewed focus.

**Optimism**

What defines a hero? An empire builder, a revolutionary, or even a redeemed villain? Here's a definition I recently embraced: true heroism is about ending your own suffering and spreading happiness to others. Life is tough, but let’s cut the weep and joke about it instead.
