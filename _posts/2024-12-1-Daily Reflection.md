What I read, think, and reflect today.

2025.1.20 – 2025.1.28
===
First week on the desk. I’ve been trying to allocate time for work, sports, music, and sleep, but I’m barely managing to keep up.

Action item:
-	Optimize schedule for >8h of sleep
-	Reserve time for daily reflection and prepping FT recruitment

**Adaptation**
This week, my focus has been on proactive outreach and providing emotional value during conversations. My goal is to stop overthinking before coming up to juniors/seniors, and ensure every chat ends with a genuine compliment. This small habit builds connections and leaves lasting impressions.

**Appreciating the Internship**
I genuinely appreciate the internship: I get paid to ask questions, understand how business works, and do a bit of work. Let’s fully enjoy my privilege to ask any question to anyone before I become a full-time. Understanding financing business also teaches me a great lesson on utilizing every asset you have. Don’t sit on costly inventories; swap them out to exchange for better return. I have the opportunity to witness how a great business works from the inside; don’t let it slip.


**Preferences on hours & pace**
I function the best on an 8 to 6, 50h/wk job. For any additional work hour, I would have to sacrifice either workout or sleep, which is probably not sustainable. And I need free time to think outside the routine: side business I can build, think about different opportunities, etc. I also notice that Fast-paced/short feedback-loop job might harm attention span. I’m less capable of doing deep research/read length math proofs after dealing with pop-up messages so frequently. I’m naturally a shorter attention span person and have been trying to expand my attention span through deliberate practice. Would I prefer to see myself as a trader/researcher onwards.

**Action over Words**
Reflection is only as valuable as the actions it inspires. It’s easy to write lengthy articles but far harder to consistently adapt. True growth requires cycles of trial, error, and reinforcement to materialize.

This internship has already taught me more in a week than six months of school. Why? 1. I am more proactively adapting when working around people. 2. I never did a real internship before. I suspect that most value of experiences are extracted from initial exposure, with diminishing margin. The same applies to knowledge. Comparing myself to my hs classmates, we have roughly the same intelligence, somewhat different characters, but wildly different experiences. The key is to proactively seek experiences with high incremental margin, throw myself in new experiences, and let it shape me.

Prepare for tomorrow and wrap up leftover questions from this week

- Futures price = Spot + Carry/Cost of holding(repo rate +/- storage cost/yield)
- Point value = par/basis. E.g. 10-Year T-note futures is quoted on points with par($100,000) on the basis of 100 points => each point = $1000. Alternatively, interpret quote as a percentage fraction of par.
- E.g. For T-note, 108'135 = 108% * 100,000 + 13.5/32 * 1000 = 108000 + 13.5 * 31.25 = $108421.875; for corn futures, 485'6 = $ 4.85 * 5000 + 6/8 * 50 
- Swaps: IBOR swaps (fixed vs floating IBOR rate), OIS swaps (fixed vs floating daily fixed overnight rate), Basis swaps (floating vs floating), Cross currency swaps (swapping interest payments in two different currencies)
- Swap prices are quoted in fixed rate

Elaborate on forward-looking questions: what struggles I might face in the next internship, what I might not enjoy, discretionary vs systematic. Don't overly rely on past experiences reason about future. Technically I am naturally methodical and need to be more intuitive.

Affirmation and proactive reflections are effective.

刚刚走在回家的路上，有很多落下的银杏叶，就像南京的一样。我想起来3年前遇到的许多人，3年后和他们交谈感觉基本没有变化。随着环境变化大家都多了domain knowledge，但人是没变的。我不希望别人和我聊天时也有这种感觉。三年前我犯的错，我的好高骛远，不自律，封闭，我看到仍然在现在的我身上。Be more conscientious about the mistakes I made, things I failed to do. 接受不适感，不断改进。

The value of college lies in knowledge and connections. With AI's rise, acquiring knowledge has shifted from studying textbooks to finding data sources and understanding key matters. College doesn't teach you any of these. What truly matters now are connections. Focus on understanding the passions of those around you.

**Dealing with failure**

My response to failure has been essentially 5 steps: denial - anger - bargaining - depressed - acceptance. When rejected after an interview, my initial reaction is denial: *How is that possible? I didn’t do badly at all*. Then comes anger: *This is ridiculous, I don’t care about them anyway*. Next, I bargain, seeking alternatives like reapplying to other offices. When those efforts fail, sadness sets in—I regret my laziness, lack of preparation, or freezing under pressure. Eventually, I accept it and move on.

The solution? Embrace the negative feelings, shorten the cycle, and return to my routine with renewed focus.

**Optimism**

What defines a hero? An empire builder, a revolutionary, or even a redeemed villain? Here's a definition I recently embraced: true heroism is about ending your own suffering and spreading happiness to others. Life is tough, but let’s cut the weep and joke about it instead.
