Life Principles
===

### Pain & fatigue are signals of problems. I learn and grow through building solutions.
- Problems recur over my life, across humans, and throughout history. The earlier you experiment with solutions the less you will suffer.
- Nothing is inherently good/bad. Be realistic —— reality happens for a reason

### This might suck for me; but what does it mean to the nature/society?
- Would the world be a better or worse place if what I'd experienced hadn't occured?
- Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual.
- Conflicts occur because ppl judge good and bad based only on how it affects them. E.g. religious conflict, and most of my emotional bursts.

### Evolution is the ultimate, permanent driver of the universe.
- Energy can't be destroyed —— it can only be reconfigured
- Knowledge, like DNA, get passed down on generations and impact the path of evolution
- The world is littered with once-great things that deteriorated and failed. Check them out; figure out why


Work Principles
===

### Identify reliable co-workers; consult with them and exchange information before engaging with the firm.
