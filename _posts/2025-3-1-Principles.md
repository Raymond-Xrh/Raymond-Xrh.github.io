Life Principles
===

#### Pain & fatigue are signals of problems. I learn and grow through building solutions.
- Problems recur over my life, across humans, and throughout history. The earlier you experiment with solutions the less you will suffer.
- Nothing is inherently good/bad; reality happens for a reason

#### This might suck for me; but what does it mean to the nature/society?
I make negative judgements or feel frustrated to unfavorable events like "rainy days are bad", "corporate job sucks". These judgements presuppose my personal experience as the metric for a phenomenon in reality. It's natural to place a disproportionately high (probably 100% before you realize it) focus on personal metrics. That's why it's more urgent to proactivly think about how "bad" phenomenon means for the nature/society —— less contrained to my ego, more holistic view of reality



Work Principles
===

#### Identify reliable co-workers; consult with them and exchange information before engaging with the firm.
