Inspired by Ray Dalio

##### Identify reliable co-workers; consult with them and exchange information before engaging with the firm.

##### This might suck for me; but what does it mean to the nature/society?
I make negative judgements or feel frustrated to unfavorable events like "rainy days are bad", "corporate job sucks". These judgements presuppose my personal experience as the metric for a phenomenon in reality. It's natural to place a disproportionately high (probably 100% before you realize it) focus on personal metrics. That's why it's more urgent to proactivly think about how "bad" phenomenon means for the nature/society —— less contrained to my ego, more holistic view of reality
