Life Principles
===

### Pain & fatigue are signals of problems. I learn and grow through building solutions.
- Problems recur over my life, across humans, and throughout history. The earlier you experiment with solutions the less you will suffer.
- Nothing is inherently good/bad. Be realistic —— reality happens for a reason

### This might suck for me; but what does it mean to the nature/society?
- Would the world be a better or worse place if what I'd experienced hadn't occured?
- Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual.



Work Principles
===

### Identify reliable co-workers; consult with them and exchange information before engaging with the firm.
