Life Principles
===

### Pain & fatigue are signals of problems. I learn and grow through building solutions.
- Problems recur over my life, across humans, and throughout history. The earlier you experiment with solutions the less you will suffer.
- Nothing is inherently good/bad. Be realistic —— reality happens for a reason

### Adapt through rapid trial and error
- How?

### This might suck for me; but what does it mean to the nature/society?
- Would the world be a better or worse place if what I'd experienced hadn't occured?
- Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual.
- Conflicts occur because ppl judge good and bad based only on how it affects them. E.g. religious conflict, and most of my emotional bursts.

### Evolution is the ultimate, permanent driver of the universe.
- Energy can't be destroyed —— it can only be reconfigured
- Knowledge, like DNA, get passed down on generations and impact the path of evolution
- The world is littered with once-great things that deteriorated and failed. Check them out; figure out why

### You are simultaneously everything, nothing, and to-be.

Work Principles
===

### Think about worse case scenario
- I tend to lack motivation to prepare for low EV and ignore their downside, e.g. I prepare for visa appointment in the last second. Reducing negative vol is just as important as gaining +EV.
-	At least don't let slackness/tiredness affect my judgments twice. E.g. no more revealing risky information, rushing traffic lights
- In work, not every conversation is an interview. But don't let your guard down before talking to managers. Collect information on their style. If they are grilly/sharp, prepare concise answer & focus on people side. 
 

### Identify reliable co-workers; consult with them and exchange information before engaging with the firm.
