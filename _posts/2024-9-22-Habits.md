My Habit List:
===


Morning:
---
No electronics before out of home. 

Wake up - Bathroom - Drink water 
Silence/EMO - Affirmation - Visualization - Exercise - Pack and get out


EMO(emotional optimization meditation): 
Start with breathing, choose a mental state (confidence, gratitude, etc), aligning physiology (smile, sit up straight, put shoulder back), 
fill my mind with positive thoughts and images, acknowledge the unsupportive thoughts and replace them with positive ones.

I am confident to solve problems never seen before. Take baby steps; ask for help. 
I am confident to embrace challenges because they enable me to learn, grow, and become a better version of myself.
I am confident to look people in their eye in micro conversations. 
I can always remain calm with what I can’t change and do the best I can do. 

When was the last time I felt that way? What did it feel like? How would I show up now if I felt that way? What would I think? What would I do? 

Affirmation:
Read with emotion and conviction! 
I am committed to becoming a quant trader no matter what - there is no other option!

This is because:
I want to live by applying abstract framework to understand the world and win practical rewards. There is not other job that can do this!
Understanding the risk and rewards behind my decisions helps me live a better life
I want to stay in the US, make enough money to live a life without worrying about basic needs. 

To ensure that I follow through with my commitment to become a quant trader, I will schedule time to implement the following actions:
Do at least 3 probability questions a day
Go through 1 line of resume and make sure I can explain everything
Apply 1 company a day
Network with people on TQD

Other style of affirmations::
ABC: Accept reality, Be grateful, Choose your optimal state
I am just as capable of creating the life I’m committed to as any other person on earth, and I will prove that today with my actions!

The underlying cause of any inner turmoil and pain is my unconscious resistance to reality - wishing I could do things perfectly. 

At every point of life, there are things that I have to feel bad about (regrets, fears, people we don’t like), and things we have to feel good about (health, life, roof over my head, education, love, food). Both lists are endless. Everyone has access to both. So what I feel is my choice but not based on external conditions. I also believe I may look back one day and regret all the time I spent crying in bed and now allowing myself to be happy.

Life can be difficult, unfair, painful, and push the limits of being utterly unbearable. However, only adversities offer us an opportunity to learn, grow, and become better than we’ve ever been. The greater our adversity, the greater our destiny. 

I must be willing to accept responsibility for every aspect of your life from this point forward and refuse to give away your power by blaming anyone else or circumstances.

I am in the process of writing your life story, and no good story is without a hero overcoming their fair share of challenges. 
Visualization:
Image the feeling of crossing finishing line, map out the day, and imagine I take them smiling with conviction 


At night:

Take supplement; prepare workout & day clothes; Map out the next day
Affirmation: 
I’m grateful for my free time, energy to realize my potential, a comfortable bed, food, and family. 
I am grateful that I am getting 7 hours of sleep. I know that my mindset influences my biology. So, regardless of how much I sleep tonight, I will wake up feeling energized and excited to do my Miracle Morning. I want to create the most extraordinary life I can imagine.
