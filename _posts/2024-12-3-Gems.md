**Dealing with failure**

My response to failure has been essentially 5 steps: denial - anger - bargaining - depressed - acceptance. When rejected after an interview, my initial reaction is denial: *How is that possible? I didn’t do badly at all*. Then comes anger: *This is ridiculous, I don’t care about them anyway*. Next, I bargain, seeking alternatives like reapplying to other offices. When those efforts fail, sadness sets in—I regret my laziness, lack of preparation, or freezing under pressure. Eventually, I accept it and move on.

The solution? Embrace the negative feelings, shorten the cycle, and return to my routine with renewed focus.
