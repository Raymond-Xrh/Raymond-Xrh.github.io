Who doesn't love movies?

Arcane 2:
===
Rating: 4.8/5

As an uncultured dude who doesn't know shit about art, I was still impressed by Arcane's rich reference to Picasso, Davincci, and the variety of artworks I can't name. The extensive styles of painting creates strong contrasts between the world in the eyes of different characters (e.g. Jinx and Vander).

I am very easily moved by plots about family, and this time it is no exception. However, what Arcane reveals to me is how human emotions/desires seem to always be a key driver in movies and series. The start of the series presents a systematic econ/political conflict between Pitover and Zaun. But before I can think any deeper, the traumas and cycles of revenge driven by systematic conflit took over the plots. At this point it seems like the drivers of the series are overwhelmed by "I want to kill you because you hurt me before" or "I want to kill you because I have to save loved ones", rather than systematic structures. I guess this is because A. most media products express their views through the lens of characters which makes emotions necessary and natural drivers and B. it's just exponentially harder to reflect on the societal structure. Anyways, it will be an interesting exercise to analyze the underlying motives of each character and see if we can figure out a better strategy than killing each other.

I was attrated by the thriller category, but fell for the melodrama. It doesn't have the most sophisticated plot: a simple combination of betrayal of friendship and forged love. For me it's more of a mirror, through the reflection I see how I also got intrigued, fell into a relatoinship, put so much of my mind into it as to fumble on my professions, and lost everything. 

It's the subtle manipulation of humanities —— forged love, resentment, jealous, lies —— that makes the plot twist so realistic. I would definitely watch it again. Tricking an odd old man to fall in love is an underrated skill.

My favourite quotes:
"Human emotions are like works of art. They can be forged. They seem just like the original, but they are a forgery."

Claire: "In an old article of yours I found on the internet, you said: There's something authentic in every forgery. What did you mean?"

Virgil Oldman: "When simulating another's work the forger can't resist the temptation to put in something of himself. 
Often it's just a trifle, a detail of no interest. One unsuspected stroke, by which the forger inevitably ends up betraying himself, and revealing his own utterly authentic sensibilities."
