Who doesn't love movies?

Arcane 2: 4.8/5
===


The Best Offer: 4.5/5
===

I was attrated by the thriller category, but fell for the melodrama. It doesn't have the most sophisticated plot: a simple combination of betrayal of friendship and forged love. For me it's more of a mirror, through the reflection I see how I also got intrigued, fell into a relatoinship, put so much of my mind into it as to fumble on my professions, and lost everything. 

It's the subtle manipulation of humanities —— forged love, resentment, jealous, lies —— that makes the plot twist so realistic. I would definitely watch it again. Tricking an odd old man to fall in love is an underrated skill.

My favourite quotes:
"Human emotions are like works of art. They can be forged. They seem just like the original, but they are a forgery."

Claire: "In an old article of yours I found on the internet, you said: There's something authentic in every forgery. What did you mean?"

Virgil Oldman: "When simulating another's work the forger can't resist the temptation to put in something of himself. 
Often it's just a trifle, a detail of no interest. One unsuspected stroke, by which the forger inevitably ends up betraying himself, and revealing his own utterly authentic sensibilities."
