Recently I've watched a lot of movies at night, to break me away from everything I care about during the day.  

The Best Offer:
===
I was attraced by it's thriller title, but fell for the melodrama. Through the lens of plots, which I have always been using to evaluate a movie,
it breaks down to friend's betrayal + forged love. But it's also a mirror, through the reflection I see how I was intrigued, fell into a relatoinship,
put so much of my mind into it as to fumble on my professions, and the loss after losing everything. 

There is no crazy twist and turns. But its the subtle manipulation of humanities —— forged love, resentment, jealous, lies —— that makes 
the plot twist so realistic. I would definitely watch it again. Tricking an odd old man to fall in love is an underrated skill.

My favourite quotes:
"Human emotions are like works of art. They can be forged. They seem just like the original, but they are a forgery."

Claire: "In an old article of yours I found on the internet, you said: There's something authentic in every forgery. What did you mean?"
Virgil Oldman: "When simulating another's work the forger can't resist the temptation to put in something of himself. 
Often it's just a trifle, a detail of no interest. One unsuspected stroke, by which the forger inevitably ends up betraying himself, 
and revealing his own utterly authentic sensibilities."
