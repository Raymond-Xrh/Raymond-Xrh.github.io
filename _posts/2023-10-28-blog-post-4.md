It feels shit when your closest family can't understand you. They want you to stick to the best track in their mind and their context, while you work your ass off to go beyond that old contexts, striving for the new dream. You suck at changing their mind. You have no bargaining power because you fucked up everything. What the fuck can you do???

But I did learn a good lesson: Verbal disagreement benefits me. It makes me think faster, clearer. I enjoy the serenpidity after an argument.
