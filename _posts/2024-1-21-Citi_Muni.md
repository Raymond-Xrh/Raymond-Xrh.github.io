Overview:
====
Citi has made significant changes to its operations, including eliminating 20,000 jobs, scaling back its overseas consumer business, and exiting the municipal bond and distressed debt markets.

Contexts:
====
Municipal Bonds Explained:
---- 
1. Issuance process

Municipal bonds are issued through underwriting, then traded on the secondary market. Banks participate in underwriting through

(1) competitive auction, where they bid to buyout the bonds, reissue on the secondary market, and collect the spread

(2) negotiated sale, where the underwriter is chosen beforehand, beneficial for ensuring right market price and and appropriate marketing.

2. Trading

(1) Many munis are bought by investors who intend to hold them until maturity due to tax exempt interest income => less liquidity => significant price movement when bonds are sold

(2) Retail investors tend to flee the market at signs of credit downgrades

(3) Fragmented market from property tax-backed highways to risky nursing homes

(4) Together, traders can profit from idiosyncrasies, but doing so takes time and ties up capital

(5) Hedging challenges. Bond dealers typically hedged against rising rates risk with derivatives. But the tax exemption on muni-bond interest makes it difficulty to craft derivatives.

Citi:
----
Citi's municipal securities division, enriched by Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney merger, operated independently from other financial institution groups. The deals give them more capital and room for taking risk.

Post-2008 financial crisis and the sale of Smith Barney (retail brokerage) to Morgan Stanley, Citi faced challenges in selling bonds directly to retail investors, alongside increased regulatory restrictions.

But crisis also created opportunities. Lower rates => more household investor need for high yields, and municipalities need better debt management. From 2011 to 2019, Citi was the muni dealer most frequently used by US institutional investors

However, strategic changes initiated in 2018 to boost trading profits led to muni team reshuffled with other desks and reduced capital allocation. Citi's 2018 decision to halt banking services for certain gun retailers led to backlash, including a 2021 Texas law preventing contracts with firms that discriminate against the firearms industry, affecting Citi's ability to issue road and school deals in the fast-growing states.

Implications:
====
States and cities need to find new partners to underwrite projects (roads, schools, sewers etc.).
Muni prices plummet as (1) one buyer fewer among the limited network of banks and funds => less liquidity (2) during market turmoil, retail bondholders tend to sell large quantities of mutual and exchange traded funds, while there are fewer institutional buyers like Citi to absorb this excess supply.
