It feels shit when people who genuinely love you can't understand you. They want you to stick to the best track in their context, while you work your ass off to live in your own context. You suck at changing their mind. Neither can you ignore them because you don't have anything.

But I did learn a few good lessons: 
1. Verbal disagreement benefits me. It forces me to think faster, clearer.
2. How to make disagreement meaningful: Ask both sides to be very precise about their claim and scope of argument. Writing down arguments could be a good way to achieve that. Then try to find agreements on both sides' claims and do some weighing.
