A constantly updated daily routine.

Morning Habits:
===
Make my bed - either brew tea or cold shower for dopamine boost - foreshadowing failure (if I don't do task XYZ I can visualize my life to be fucked in ABC ways) - "You find your will in the suck" - map out each hour of the day with atomic, measuable tasks - meditate in the sun - some quick exercises - extra time under the sun (30min if cloudy else 15min). 

Work Habits:
===

1. No social media before all tasks are done.

2. Consciously time the amount of focused work; generate random reward as f(intensity, duration).


**Tools when I feel the task is boring/too much:**


Exercise: 5min of push-up/jumps


Just try 2 mins: Recognize that procastination stems from fear/anxiety of the task is too length/hard. Make atomic steps.


Leveraging gaze: look at a dot or line for 30 seconds then move to work to enhance focus


**Tools when I am actually tired:**


NSDR(non-sleep deep rest)/Yoga nidra, count heart beat, listening to music, walking


**Things I should absolutely avoid:**


Browsing large amount of information messes up my brain.


Sleep Habits:
===
No light after 10pm!
