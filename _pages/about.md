Who am I? 
------

Hello! I'm Raymond Xia, a UC Berkeley student studying Math and CS. Welcome to my space where I curate and share the ideas that resonate with me deeply. 

My intellectual journey began with a deep passion for philosophy and debate, which has since evolved into a focus on the intersection of science, public market investing, and quantitative trading. Here, you'll find updates on book reviews, blog posts, and my latest trading ideas.
