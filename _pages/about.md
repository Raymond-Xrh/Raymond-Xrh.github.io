I am a lazy thinker captured by some vague questions on self and the world. Some of them include:
1. How to integrate quantitative, fundamental, and macro into one framework of trading?
2. What's my optimal learning algorithm: treating a concept as a practical tool, exploring its ontological significance among my web of knowledge, or understand it only to the extent I can use it?
3. What's the key to a happy life?
